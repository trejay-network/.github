# Contributing to TreJay

Welcome to the TreJay Network! 👋  
We’re building a next-generation blockchain with credibility, sustainability, and global adoption at its core.  
Whether you’re a developer, researcher, or community member, we’re glad you’re here.

## 🛠 Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** you want to work on.  
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).  
3. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages.  
4. **Push to your fork** and open a **Pull Request (PR)** against the `main` branch.  
5. A member of the **Core Devs** team will review your PR.  
6. Once approved and CI tests pass, it will be merged.

## ✅ Code Standards

- All contributions must include tests where applicable.  
- Changes must not break the **max supply (42M 3JAY)** or other critical invariants.  
- Follow existing code style and documentation patterns.  
- Keep commits atomic and focused.  

---

## 🔒 Branch Protection

- The `main` branch is **protected**.  
- All changes must go through PR review.  
- CI/CD checks must pass before merging.  

---

## 📜 Licensing

All contributions are under the **MIT License** unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## 🤝 Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and professional.  
- No spam, scams, or unrelated promotion.  
- Discussions should remain focused on TreJay, 3JAY, and related ecosystem development.  

---

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

- Use GitHub Issues in the relevant repo.  
- Clearly describe the problem and steps to reproduce.  
- Mark issues with appropriate labels (bug, enhancement, docs, etc.).

## 🔐 Security

If you discover a vulnerability, **do not** create a public issue.  
Instead, please follow our [Security Policy](https://github.com/trejay-network/trejay-chain/blob/main/SECURITY.md)  
and email **security@trejay.com**.

## 🌍 Governance

TreJay will evolve through on-chain governance. Major changes to protocol parameters or economics must follow the proposal process documented in [GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/trejay-network/docs/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).
