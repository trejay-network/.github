# Contributing to TreJay

We welcome contributions from the community!  

## Workflow
1. Fork the repository.  
2. Create a feature branch.  
3. Submit a Pull Request (PR).  
4. A Core Dev will review and merge after tests pass.  

## Code of Conduct
All contributors are expected to act with professionalism and respect.  

## Branch Protection
The `main` branch is protected. All changes must go through PR review.
